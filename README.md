# Def Not Another MMORPG

Welcome to **Def Not Another MMORPG**! This game is a personal project aimed at creating an exciting role-playing experience while learning and improving my skills in Unity, C#, and game development.

## Project Overview

- **Start Date**: June 20, 2024
- **Original Purpose**: Refactor legacy code from a previous project started on September 12, 2022, which was initially meant for studying Unity and game development.
- **Current Goal**: Finish the game with lots of features and polished gameplay.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Engine**: Unity
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Version Control**: Git

## What I've Done So Far

- **Inventory System**: Players can collect and manage items found in the game world.
- **Combat System**: Implemented dynamic combat mechanics with various abilities.
- **Items and Abilities**: Created a variety of items and abilities to enhance the player character.
- **Movement Mechanics**: Developed smooth and responsive controls for navigating the game world.
- **Enemies and Aggro Management**: Designed enemy AI that reacts to player actions and manages aggression levels.
- **Enemy Drops**: Set up a loot system where defeated enemies drop items and resources.
- **Character States**: Implemented various behaviors like wandering, patrolling, and engaging in combat.

## What's Next

- **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**: Add interactive characters who offer quests and services.
- **Quest System**: Develop missions that drive the story and provide rewards.
- **Shopping System**: Implement an in-game economy for buying and selling items through merchants.
- **User Interface (UI)**): Create user-friendly menus and displays for inventory, quests, and more.
- **Map Creation**: Design and build new maps beyond the current example map.

## Design Patterns Used

- **Command Pattern**: For handling player actions and commands in a flexible way.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows for interchangeable behaviors in movement and combat systems.
- **State Pattern**: Manages different states of game objects to change behaviors dynamically.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of key classes like game managers.
- **Observer Pattern** (Coming Soon): For event-driven communication between objects.
- **Factory Pattern** (Coming Soon): To streamline the creation of items and enemies.

## Project Scope

The game aims to offer:

- **Multiple Scenes**: Explore diverse environments with unique challenges.
- **Various Enemies**: Face foes of different levels, each with unique loot drops.
- **Engaging Quests**: Complete missions involving defeating enemies and collecting items.
- **Economic System**: Sell loot to NPCs to earn currency for better gear.
- **Character Progression**: Level up to unlock new abilities and skills.

*Note: There is currently no build available. Once it's ready, a beta version will be published at [https://danilocolasso.itch.io/](https://danilocolasso.itch.io/) to play in the browser.*
